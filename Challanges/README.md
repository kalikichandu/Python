# `Sort even-placed elements in increasing and odd-placed in decreasing order`

We are given an array of n distinct numbers, the task is to sort all even-placed numbers in increasing and odd-place numbers in decreasing order. The modified array should contain all sorted even-placed numbers followed by reverse sorted odd-placed numbers.

Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, 14, 12} <br/>
Output: {2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 14, 9, 4, 1}<br/>
Even-place elements : 3, 2, 5, 13, 12<br/>
Odd-place elements : 1, 4, 9, 14<br/>
Even-place elements in increasing order :<br/> 
2, 3, 5, 12, 13<br/>
Odd-Place elements in decreasing order :<br/> 
14, 9, 4, 1<br/>
