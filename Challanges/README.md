# `Sort even-placed elements in increasing and odd-placed in decreasing order`

We are given an array of n distinct numbers, the task is to sort all even-placed numbers in increasing and odd-place numbers in decreasing order. The modified array should contain all sorted even-placed numbers followed by reverse sorted odd-placed numbers.

Input: arr[] = {3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, 14, 12} 
Output: {2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 14, 9, 4, 1}
Even-place elements : 3, 2, 5, 13, 12
Odd-place elements : 1, 4, 9, 14
Even-place elements in increasing order : 
2, 3, 5, 12, 13
Odd-Place elements in decreasing order : 
14, 9, 4, 1
